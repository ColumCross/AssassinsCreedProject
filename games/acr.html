	<h1>Assassin's Creed: Revelations</h1>
	<h5>Year made: 2011</h5>
	<h2>Basic plot line:</h2>
		<p>Revelations continues the story of Desmond Miles, who has fallen into a coma due to the events of the previous game. In order for him to awaken again, Desmond must relive the last significant memories of his ancestor, the Assassin Mentor Ezio Auditore da Firenze, who sought out the secret library of the Mentor of the Levantine Assassins, Alta&iuml;r Ibn-La'Ahad, in 1511.</p>

	<h2>What I liked:</h2>
		<p>More of the same. They added new things like the Hook-Blade, which allows you to use a zip-line, and bombs which end up being an important tool. The bombs part of the game is interesting and fun.
		You get three types of bomb: Distraction, dispersion, and lethal. Distraction attracts guards to a spot, dispersion allows you to flee, and lethal kills guards. Each bomb has three parts you can customize.
		It becomes important to master each bomb type as you progress because they can make the missions a lot easier if used properly.</p>
		<p>Another element added to the game is this tower defence aspect used to protect assassin dens from Templars. At first I thought this was just going to be one of those things that they introduce at the beginning and then never use again.
		I was wrong; halfway through the game I used the mini-game to save a den from Templar rule.</p>
	<h2>What I disliked:</h2>
		<p>There were only three things wrong with this game. One: Only one location: Constantinople. Although the city was big, it wasn't diverse enough for my liking, and this is the only game in the series I've played so far where there are no horses.
		Two: Runs off the same engine as AC II. When I was playing this game I had to keep checking when it was made, because I couldn't believe it was from 2011. The game looked like something from 2009. I wonder why. Maybe, because ACR was just supposed to be another piece of DLC that got too big.
		Whatever it was, the game looked dated. Finally: This was Ezio's last game. That makes me sad. I love Ezio, he is my favorite! It was sad to see him go, however, I am glad I got to play him from beginning to end.</p>
