	<h1>Assassin's Creed: Alta&iuml;r's Chronicles</h1>
	<h5>Year made: 2008</h5>
	<h2>Basic plot line:</h2>
		<p>In the year 1190, the wars of the Third Crusade engulfed the Holy Land, and Crusaders clashed with Saracens for the control of the Holy City, Jerusalem.
		Alta&iuml;r Ibn-La'Ahad, a renowned Master Assassin of the Assassin Order, arrived at Alep from an arduous journey and found it under attack by the sworn enemies of the Assassins, the Knights Templar. Left with no choice but to repel the attack, the Assassin defeated many of them, even killing a low-ranking captain before the attack was halted.
		Afterwards, tasked by Rashid ad-Din Sinan, the Mentor of the Levantine Assassins, Alta&iuml;r was sent to find and retrieve a sacred object known as the Chalice, which was said to have the power to unite all the factions under one flag of whichever side possessed it, ending the Third Crusade in victory for either the Crusaders or the Saracens. Setting off immediately, Alta&iuml;r embarked on his new quest. </p>

	<h2>What I liked:</h2>
		<p>This was the first Assassin's Creed game I ever played. I got it for the iPad during a Ubisoft sale. I enjoyed it a lot. To me it played a lot like God of War.
		THe story was well thought out, and there was the voice acting was excellent. I was really impressed by the amount of work that went into this game.</p>
	<h2>What I disliked:</h2>
		<p>Somehow they managed to bring their crappy control responses to the mobile world as well. I was still floundering around the map. The were times where I would literally say, "What!? Why did I do that!?"
		The other big thing that a lot of people had problems with is that in Alta&iuml;r's Chronicles there is no free roaming. It is the definition of a linear storyline. Giant arrows point you here and there,
		and if you don't follow them correctly, you die.</p>
		<p>Overall, I think that this game was well thought out, and a pretty good mobile game.</p>
