	<h1>Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood</h1>
	<h5>Year made: 2010</h5>
	<h2>Basic plot line:</h2>
		<p>The story once again features Ezio Auditore da Firenze, now a legendary Master Assassin, as he strives to rebuild the Assassin Brotherhood in Rome, by bringing down the tyrannical Templar family, the Borgia, and bringing the city into the true wealth and wonder of the Renaissance.</p>

	<h2>What I liked:</h2>
		<p>Basically Brotherhood is Assassin's Creed II.5. It was originally meant as DLC, but when kept adding to it they realized that they needed to make it a whole new game.
		And it shows that it's more than just DLC. ACB is a very rich game. Both the Desmond and Ezio parts are very well thought out. The story is good, and there are a lot of extra bits that make this game great.
		So many new mechanics were introduced into Brotherhood, such as De Vinci's machines, that really made the game good.</p>
		<p>Brotherhood is beginning to be the point where there's not much more you can say about the game as a game. I would have to talk about the story and parts of the story which I don't want to get into for fear of spoilers.</p>
	<h2>What I disliked:</h2>
		<p>Only a couple of things were wrong with this game really. One, bad parkour engine, as always. Two, the extra mechanics that were introduced, were only introduced once. I was hoping that they would do more with each of the stuff they used.
		Finally, in the first game Lucy Stillman reveals that she is missing here left ring finger. However, in Brotherhood she has all ten fingers. WHAT THE HECK!?!?!?! That was a semi-important piece of cannon that was completely forgotten. The lack of care for cannon should have been the first warning. I was so naive.</p>
